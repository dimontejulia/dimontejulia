### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a web developer and graduate of Queen's University with a Bachelor of Computing, I look for opportunities to compliment my passion for innovation and technology. I have experience working on various stages of the software development lifecycle as a quality assurance engineer and in product support. I am excited at the opportunity to gain more experience developing as a web developer. My interests range from software applications, social media, fashion, design, music, and sports.
